                    <p>I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying fashionable.

                    <p>In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.</p> <br />
